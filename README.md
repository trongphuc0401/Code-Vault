# Library_Managment_Systems_for_Programmer
The Library Book Management System for Programmerallows users to sign up, log in, and log out using their email. When users need to log in, they must first sign up by visiting the sign-up page and entering their email and password. This process is referred to as the Login Module. The system then provides them with an authentication letter before they can successfully log in. This step is known as the Sign-up Module. Once logged in, users can check out books and place them on the Bookshelf. They also have the ability to search for specific books they're interested in. The Search Books Page presents a list of available books, and this functionality is handled by the Search Module. In the Bookshelf section, users can view the 'Loans' table and 'Your History'. The 'Loans' table manages the books that users have checked out. Within this table, users can return books and renew loans for an additional 7 days. The 'History' Table displays information about previously checked-out books, including the dates they were borrowed and returned. This feature is part of the Shelf Module and the Checkout Module. Users can interact with the administrator by asking questions and making inquiries via the Messages Page. This page interfaces with two tables: 'Submit Question' and 'Q/A Response/Pending'. Users can post and add their questions to the system by providing the necessary details in the 'Submit Question' section. This functionality constitutes the Message Module. The administrator holds the authority to post, edit, and delete books, users, and messages through the Management Page. This administrative capability is encapsulated in the Administrator  Module.
